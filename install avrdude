Installation: USAP-Programmer with ubuntu

23. September 2012 von pschmidt | 3 Kommentare

Two weeks ago, I purchased a ISP-Programmer and ATmega328p from Guloshop. The programmer is based on the USBasp designed by Fischl. Since then, I had some trouble getting the programmer recognized with Ubuntu 12.04. Hereâ€™s a quick tutorial how to fix this, so you can get your hands dirty.

Install AVRdude and libftdi1 using
1
	
sudo apt-get install avrdude

So after this, plug in the USB-Programmer and promt dmesg
1

3
	
$ dmesg
[...]
[15014.460382] usb 5-1: new low-speed USB device number 4 using uhci_hcd

As you can see, a new usb-device is recognized. Search for the device/folder called USBasp in your device folder
1
	
$ ls /dev

If the folder is not in there, try to list all usb-devices itself unsing lsusb
1
	
$ lsusb
1

Bus 006 Device 002: ID 046d:c526 Logitech, Inc. Nano Receiver
Bus 007 Device 002: ID 044e:3017 Alps Electric Co., Ltd BCM2046 Bluetooth Device
Bus 005 Device 004: ID 16c0:05dc VOTI shared ID for use with libusb

There you can see a device with the ID 16c0:05dc. This is the USBasp-programmer. 16c005dc is the VendorID and 05dc is the ProductID. We need this information for our next step.

To get the programmer recognized we have to define a new rule for a service called udev
1
	
sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-objdev.rules

Copy the following lines into the file and save it
1
	
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="05dc", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="USBasp"

After this, restart udev
1
	
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart

Plugin your USBasp-Programmer, list your /dev/ folder and you will see a simlink called USBasp.
